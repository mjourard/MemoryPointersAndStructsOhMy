Just some Documentation...

A small limitation of the program is if you select an X or an O that is already placed on
the board (which is cheating anyway to try to take their spot), the game will skip your turn. 
There is also no undo function so I'm sorry to say that. 

If you want to quit at any time, just press the "Q" key and you will be asked if you want to quit 
the game. Just hit "y" for yes and you'll exit the game.

In cases of there being no moves in the top row, the victory conditions won't necessarily register
for the game, so if you win, just keep enter moves, specifically in the top left corner, and it'll
register eventually.

Enjoy
